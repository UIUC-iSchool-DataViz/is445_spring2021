# Finish up with Iodide, Intro to Idyll 

Today we'll cover a brief intro of [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/) and web development in general.

<!--
## Downloads & Links

### Iodide Notebooks:

 * We'll finish up with this notebook: <a href="https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/6217/">Prep Iodide Notebook</a>
 * <a href="https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/6219/">In Class Iodide Notebook</a> 
 
 Feel free to check out [Spring 2020's notebook that uses police shooting data for visualization](https://alpha.iodide.io/notebooks/4399/) if you are interested in other mappable datasets.

### Idyll Files & Example pages

We'll be building toward [this index.idyll file right here](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/is445AOG_fall2020/blob/master/week11/corg/prepIdyll/index.idyll).


Further examples include:
 * Website from [Spring 2020](https://jnaiman.github.io/items_dataviz_spring2020/) which focuses on using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to do many plots since vega-lite was not working well at that time.  The index.idyll file, along with example d3 components and a styles.css file for the final map are in [this subdirectory from that course page here](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/tree/master/week15/corg).

### Data

 1. <a href="corg/corgs_per_country_over_time_columns_2020.csv" download>Corgis per country over time (corgs_per_country_over_time_columns_2020.csv)</a>
 1. <a href="corg/corgiData_countries_subset_2020.json" download>Subset of full Corgi database (corgiData_countries_subset_2020.json)</a>
     * Full dataset available [here](corg/corgiData_countries_full_2020.json)
 
This dataset is from the [Cardigan Archives](http://cardiped.net/) and [scraped using Beautiful Soup in Python](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week12/corg/grabCorgData_subpages.py) and [further processed in Python](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week12/corg/calc_corgData.ipynb) into this form.
 
### Links & Code

 1. We'll be building toward a webpage like [this](https://jnaiman.github.io/) today using [Idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/)'s built-in components.
 1. We got to this [Markdown code right here in Class this week](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week12/corg/inClass/index.idyll).
 1. Full Markdown code for this week and next week [available right here](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/spring2020/blob/master/week12/corg/index.idyll).
